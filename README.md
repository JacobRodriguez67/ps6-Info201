 This is the short overview of the Car Data App
 The first page gives a brief overview of the app and what it shows with the table and plot pages both displaying different information
 The first page also shows a sample of the data used from the car_data.csv file which has some of the following information: 
The Model column provides information on the brand of car and the specific type as well as manufactured year.
    The Status column provides information on whether a car is brand new or secondhand (used)
    The Mileage column provides information on the distance covered by used cares in miles
    The price column contains information on the rate at which a care is being offered for sale
    The MSRP (Manufacturer Suggested Retail Price) column provide information on the price the car makers are suggesting a car should be retailed. The rows with the available information either quotes the price or the discount at which the current selling price is at variance with the MSRP.
    The year column indicates the year a car was manufactured


 The Table page takes a model selected fromt eh dropdown menu and shows the vehicles that match the model and displays the information on those vehicles 
 The plot page takes two arguments selected by the user and creates a plot according to the options selected. The user can also choose the status of the vehicle (Used, New, All)
